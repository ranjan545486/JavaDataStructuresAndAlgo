 * Given a list of houses and the cost of painting each house,
 * the houses can be painted in three colors RED, GREEN and BLUE, two neighboring houses canâ€™t be painted in the same color,
 * calculate the total minimum cost for painting all houses.
 * Sol: 1) Dynamic programming problem.
 2)Maintain a array of min cost called min_cost,
    each column represent a color and each row represent a houses.
 3) min_cost[i][0] represents that, when the ith house is painted Red,
    the min cost of 0 to ith houses. Thus we have the following:
 min_cost{i} = min(
 //since the current color cannot be the same as the previous one
 cost[i][R] + min(cost{i-1, B}, cost{i-1, G}),
 cost[i][B] + min(cost{i-1, R}, cost{i-1, G}),
 cost[i][G] + min(cost{i-1, R}, cost{i-1, B})
 )
