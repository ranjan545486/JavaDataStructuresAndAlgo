/**
 * Created by rmukherj on 8/22/16.
 * Swap operation: Given a tree and a integer, K, we have to swap the subtrees of all
 * the nodes who are at depth h, where h âˆˆ [K, 2K, 3K,...].

 You are given a tree of N nodes where nodes are indexed from [1..N] and it is
 rooted at 1. You have to perform T swap operations on it, and after each swap
 operation print the inorder traversal of the current state of the tree.

 Input Format: First line of input contains N, number of nodes in tree.
 Then N lines follow. Here each of ith line (1 <= i <= N) contains two integers, a b,
 where a is the index of left child, and b is the index of right child of ith node. -1
 is used to represent null node. Next line contain an integer, T. T
 hen again T lines follows. Each of these line contains an integer K.
